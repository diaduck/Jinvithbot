Still thinking about peanuts. How fucking stupid are they. They don't retain their iconic peanut shape when you eat them. Fucking scam really. Where are the edible parts of the peanut stored within the shell? Are there two edible peanut flesh parts, one per bubble of shell, or is it simply one lodged in the middle, or even archaically only one flesh part within a single random side of the peanut shell?

If I was a sand particle, possibly floating through the otion as debris kicked up by a particularly unruly fish, I would simply be in the most perfect state of being. No capabilities to think, just experience the crashing waves of the ocean, lapping the beachfront - occasionally landing a few drops of water on my being, perhaps drenching me even, the wind blowing through my non hair,  my fellow sand brothers surround me - particles vibrating in the hot summer sun, keeping my sandy body warm from all sides - with the sun taking care of the top of course, all adding up to keep me in a perpetual state of bliss. What a life that would be. I would only ever be a beach sand you would never catch me in a desert (I'm sand racist)

If somebody swapped your body with a fish, and you had to swap into their old body to try and get your body back, what lengths would you go to to get your body back? For some additional context their body is decomposing and you have to go on a mission where theres a 50% chance you die trying to get your original body back. Do you think its worth the risk of dying to become you again or would being a fish with a humans brain just be chill?

I think a super scary dream would be if you were asleep and dreaming, but didn't know you were dreaming, hence making it scary, and you couldn't find your genitals. Obviously you would be dreaming so they would most likely still be there, but you don't know that you're asleep so you not being able to find your genitals would be super scary. Most people want to keep their genitals so the thought of them being missing is naturally alarming, and obviously, you would be asleep so you would have no idea that what is currently happening, i.e. your genitals being missing, is just a figment of your imagination as you are asleep and dreaming.

[21/07/2024 14:30] jinvithal
To add to this, alot of things in dreams can be scary since very unrealistic things can happen, since it's all just fake events created by your dozing mind, this can lead to some unrealistic but still real feeling dreams, in this case your genitals being missing, as your brain is unable to discern the fact that the events are unrealistic and possibly a dream, making it way scarier, since if you were just to think about your genitals being missing, it's not that scary, but if you actually thought they were missing you would be scared, and you dreaming would make you more likely to think that they're actually gone, which would be quite scary.

I am the only one to EVER, be beyond myself. No-one else HAS or WILL EVER go so above and beyond, that mass hysteria ensues. Lighthouse 5. If I was making a map, game or otherwise,  there would have to be a horribly misnamed place; such as Lighthouse 5-8 despite it maybe not being a lighthouse or maybe it not being either Lighthouse 5, 6, 7 or 8 but maybe Lighthouse 12.

Red Dead Redemption 2: Micheal Edition. It's just normal RDR2 except you play as a completely irrelevant character called Micheal and you just follow the gang around and everyones all confused and gossiping about who you are. Nobody ever invited you to the gang you just found them because of mission markers, but they also don't try to shoot you because you help them and such, obviously because it's the same game the gang just don't know who you are. You never say anything and you just sorta chill until the cool shooty missions start then they sorta just accept you because you've been there for like at least a month and have only helped.

How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if I was the woodchuck and I was in a pile of wood surrounded by wood I'm chucking it buried beneath it I'm buried beneath the wood? how did I get here? Oh no. No no no no no! Someone's burning the wood. It's still on top of me. I'm next. I'm chucking wood! I'm trying my little woodchuck hardest to chuck as much wood as I can. Hot. I can barely see the wood through the glow. I'm not a wood, so I wont burn, right? Oh god I don't want to be a fuel, but there's just way too much wood. Too much for a little woodchuck to chuck before he himself becomes a living wood. Hah, we'll not living for long! Now's not the time for jokes I'm about to die over here! Damn alot of trees must've been slaughtered for there to be this much wood just laying around. Why am I under all this wood? Is he stupid? So much carbon emission from this pile alone. I'm still hucking and chucking wood by the way. I wonder if I'll release carbon or oxygen when I burn. Ow. I just got a splinter. Piece of shit wood I hope you burn slow. Chucked a good 40 pieces of wood at this point but it's still getting hotter and hotter. Gotta keep going. I'm going to pee on the fire above me to put it out like a little fireman. Wee-woo Wee-woo Wee-woo. Hell yeah, now I'm chucking my wet pee wood! Woodchuck wood chucking has officially reached 50 woods chucked, however, I shall soon be dead. By fire if you couldn't infer. Do wood chucks eat wood? Are they like beavers? To be honest I have no idea what they even are or if they're even real. Gadagadegedaio. If I was a wood chuck would I really get stuck underneath all this wood? Shit, maybe. Would I wood all over the place? Heck yes. We should make solitaire for wood. You can move various types and amounts of wooden planks to replicate cards. Would wood chucks eat the cards or chuck them? Beaver Wallace is a potential user for wood solitaire. Make sure he would like it, he enjoys playing with his food, which is wood.

Geese is bad for bread, put a bread on a geese and it goes goose mode. Bake a goose into the bread and you have an abomination, goose should not be baked goose should be free and wild and full of flour and water and yeast. More geese need to be made into sandwiches, the common waterfowl should not consume bread but should rather be consumed by bread to make a delectable lunch. Geese have too many feathers to eat raw.
