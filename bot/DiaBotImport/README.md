# DiaBot!
\
At the root of this project is a file called `config.properties` - this **doesn't** get pushed to github.\
If you are taking from this project, you **MUST MAKE THIS FILE.**\
Within the file, you must write the line `bot.token=BOT-TOKEN` where BOT-TOKEN is the token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)\
An example would be `bot.token=ABC1EfG2HIJ3KL456MNO7PQR8.STUVW.XYZ-abcdEfGhiJklMNopqrStuvWxyz`
