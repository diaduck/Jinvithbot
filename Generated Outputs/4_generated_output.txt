The Democratic Party has been around since the beginning of time.

It was founded in 1866, and the first party to start with a specific goal was just to make sure that people were happy.

When people were looking for a way to make sure they had a good life, they would just go to the polls.

What they saw was a lot of people saying, "I'm so depressed, I need help."

The people who really wanted to change the world were those people who were really into the idea of a better life.
