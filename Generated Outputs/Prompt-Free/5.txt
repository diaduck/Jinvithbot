Cape Town - South Africa are the only team to qualify for the next World Cup and are currently in a relegation zone after their group stage defeat to Germany.

The team's place in the group stages has fallen by a single point from their previous best point of the campaign and their only chance to make the knockout stages has been a 2-0 victory over Germany, who have also won only once in their last 14 matches.

The team are unlikely to make the knockout stages if they do not qualify for the next World Cup in 2017 and would need to play a game of football in the group stages to qualify for the next round.

The fact that their group of opponents are the same team as them is a testament to how little they can play.

The team's best chance to make the knockout stages is a 2-0 win over a side who are well above their best, but who are currently in the relegation zone.

If they only qualify for the next World Cup in 2017 and would play a game of football in the group stages, why are they not playing for the next five World Cups?

If they play a game of football in the group stages, why are they not playing for the next five World Cups?

The reason that the media is so obsessed with the idea of a man being born to be a gay man is because most people think that people born gay are born into being straight guys. They've never even thought of that before.

If I had to find a way to make a man who only had a penis look like a gay boy, I would be a straight guy, right?

If anyone else would know how to make a man look like a gay guy, would they?

I'm sure many people would.

If you're one of those people, you're probably tired of hearing people say it.
