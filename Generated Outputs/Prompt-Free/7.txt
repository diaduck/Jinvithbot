A woman who was beaten by a man after she stopped at a gas station to buy a hamburger in a local restaurant was arrested by a local police officer.

The incident happened one day after Thanksgiving and occurred on the western edge of town, where police said the woman had just been to the end of a fast food restaurant when the man began to chase her.

According to local media reports, the man chased her down a few blocks and then ran across the street to the park where he was assaulted. The woman was taken to the hospital where she had a broken neck, but has not been seen since.

Police say the man was arrested after he ran away, but there's no word on exactly why.

The man, who was not identified, told local media that he was a man who had a history of alcohol problems and was in a relationship. He also said that he had a gun and was going to kill himself, but never did. He also said he had a knife.

"I'm just really worried about my life," he said. "I thought it would be a good idea to just walk around the park and just kill the guy. I just think he's such a creep."

Dairy milk has been used as a dietary supplement for more than a thousand years.

Cute.

It is a wonder milk is not considered a health food.

A good diet is one with lots of eggs and milk and plenty of fish.

It is also called a Paleo diet, a balanced diet.

Paleo isn't a new concept.

Paleo was invented by Dr. John C. King in 1844.

In the 1800s, Dr. King was a proponent of the idea that the body was more evolved to fight disease.

Dr. King was also the first to believe that humans were not as good as animals.

If you are a vegan, you may be a better diet choice.

Paleo is a diet you should try every day.

If you don't like Paleo, go to a vegan restaurant.

If you are a vegetarian, go to a vegetarian restaurant.

Do you think it would be a waste of your life to eat only dairy products?

Paleo is the only food I think would be the best choice for you.

If you are a vegetarian, you will probably be a better diet choice
