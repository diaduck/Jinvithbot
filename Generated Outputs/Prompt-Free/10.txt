BANGOR, Maine — The state's top federal prosecutor has been removed after being charged with fraud, criminal mischief, obstructing justice, and obstruction of justice.

U.S. Attorney David H. Kendall announced Monday that federal prosecutors are being dismissed.

Kendall denied the accusations in a statement.

"The Department of Justice has been notified that Acting U.S. Attorney David Kendall is departing the office and must be placed on administrative leave," Kendall said in the statement.
