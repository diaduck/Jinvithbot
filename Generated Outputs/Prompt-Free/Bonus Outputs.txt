The first ever attempt to make a real wall painting was done by a wall painter.

If you're into that kind of thing, you should probably just go for it.

How?

If you're gonna try to take your wall painting to a certain level of artistry, you need to make sure to make it a little bit more realistic to the point where you can actually see through it.

If you're gonna throw it around like a balloon and start to grow, then just be careful not to get the paint stuck in your throat.

If you're gonna paint your body so badly that you're going to never see it again, then just make sure you're not going to ever see your body again.

If you're gonna paint your face so badly that you look like you've been kidnapped by a leopard that you're going to never see you again, then just make sure you're not going to ever see your face again.

If you're gonna paint your brain so badly that your eyes will be full of dead pixels, then just paint your eyes like they're a real woodpecker.

If you're gonna paint your brain so badly that you completely lose your coordination and become a complete zombie
