do you know anything about the real world?

Just ask me.

The only thing I do is go and play video games, because I'm a gamer.

If I ever saw a video game, I would take the time to think, "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a person pee, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a tree get cut, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw people pee on top of each other, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a dog pee, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a watermelon get kicked, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a tree get stuck in a tree, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a person pee on top of each other, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"

If I ever saw a tree get stuck in a tree, I would take the time to think "How is that possible?"
